# Die Stats

This crate is yet another library providing (hopefully) easy to use structs for handling different dice, as well as providing a foundation for implementing other sources of different kinds of probability distributions.

Includes special cases, like exploding and roll x drop n highest/lowest and simple arithmetic implementations to mutate created die.

There are still some TODOS, but I don't know when I'll get to them/I'll continue to work on this. For now, this project won't be my main focus from now on. Notable things that are still missing:
- easier creation of new die
- expanded examples to show capabilities (probably also examples in the readme)
- generalize a bunch of stuff even more
- and most importantly: actually learn Rust more and write more idiomatic Rust code in general
